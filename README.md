# PeaceSimulator
Peace Simulator based on Mendieta's social physics of peace
# 🕊️ Peace Score Simulator

This interactive web app models **Eduardo Mendieta's formula of peace** using a neural network. It allows users to adjust key sociopolitical variables—like legal structure, memory, moral outrage, and democracy—and see a **predicted peace score** in real time.

Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), the model formalizes Mendieta’s account of peace:

> *"Peace is not the absence of war, but a function of the spatiotemporal ordering of a legal order that is subject to revision through collective memory, moral outrage, and democratic struggle."*

## ⚙️ Features

- 🎛️ Adjustable sliders for five variables:
  - **Legal Order (Spatial and Temporal)**
  - **Collective Memory**
  - **Moral Outrage**
  - **Democratic Struggle**

- 📈 Peace score output with a real-time bar chart.
- 🧠 Powered by a neural network trained on a simulated dataset.
- 💡 Designed for academic and experimental exploration.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. A simulated dataset is generated using nonlinear relationships between legal order and revision capacity.
2. A neural network is trained to predict a peace score between **0 and 1**.
3. User input is normalized and passed through the model to generate predictions live.

## 📚 Theoretical Background

This project operationalizes Mendieta's peace formula:P = f(𝓛(x, t), R(M, O, D))

Where:
- `𝓛(x, t)`: Legal Order across space and time.
- `R(M, O, D)`: Revision function based on Memory, Outrage, and Democratic struggle.
